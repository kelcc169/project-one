## So-La-Mi

So-La-Mi is a pitch recognition game for elementary age music students.  Players will take turns listening to short pitch patterns and clicking the corresponding hand signs.  Correctly matching the signs will give the player a point.  If the pitch pattern is “so-la-mi”, the name of the game, the player has to do nothing. If the click anything on “so-la-mi”, they lose a point.

Level 1 has pitches appropriate for 1st grade and early 2nd grade.
Level 2 has pitches appropriate for 2nd grade and early 3rd grade.
Level 3 has pitches appropriate for 3rd grade.
Level 4 has pitches appropriate for 4th grade and up.

Disco Mode is an option that adds several additional challenges to the game.  Music is played at the same time as the pitches being sung, making it more difficult to pick out right notes.  The screen changes colors, and the buttons change places every time the player changes.  Toggling off Disco Mode resets everything to its original state for the start of the next game.

After the game ends, players can change the levels and play again.

## Designing the Gameplay

I wanted to base the game off of a game that I played with my students when I was a teacher - So La Mi.  Basically, the teacher sings a three note pattern using whatever notes the students know, and the students repeat. When they hear the pattern “so-la-mi,” they stay silent. If any of the kids make a sound, the teacher gets a point. If not, the class gets a point.

To make this a two player game, I decided to have the two players take turns repeating the pattern and tracking the correct answers. Later, I added "so-la-mi" as a pattern that will take away points if the player responds to it.
